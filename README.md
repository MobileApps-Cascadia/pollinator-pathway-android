# The Pacific Northwest Pollinator Pathway (PNWPP)
* The PNW Pollinator Pathway App is a robust registration and communication tool for new or existing pathway members.  Features include registering your new pollinator box via the included QR code, viewing existing pathway sites and their associated profiles, meeting and chatting with members, and a live map of the pathway!

## Customers / Stakeholders
* New / Incoming members
* Existing members
* Administrators / Owners / Volunteers

## Personas
* Matt has a farm and just joined the Pollinator Pathway. 
* Amy’s a member of the PNW Pollinator Pathway and her pollinator garden has expanded.
* Alex is the president of the PNW Pollinator Pathway.

## Pain points and user needs
* Matt is unsure how to register his site with the pathway.
* Amy is having difficulty updating her information for her site.
* Alex does not currently have administrative access and control of accounts

## Scenarios
* Matt has a farm and just joined the pollinator pathway.  He wants to set up his site information with a name, description, photos, and a link to his website. 
* Amy’s Pollinator garden has expanded and she can go on the app to edit her information.
* Alex wants to have administrative access and control of accounts.

## Competitive analysis
* Pollination Network - App to connect beekeepers and growers, includes location / map, type of crop, bees needed, and price.  More of a marketplace tool than outreach product but closest thing to PNWPP.

* My Pollination - App to book professional pollination services for growers.  Again marketplace tool mainly, but includes some similar features like maps, listings, and different pollinators.

* Pollination Hotel - App for program and University of Michigan that distributes pollinator kits.  Apps features include map / location, types of pollinators, and various educational uses. Closest thing to our app and limited to UofM distributions.
