1.	 PNW Pollinator Pathway 
The PNW Pollinator Pathway App is a robust registration and communication tool for new or existing pathway members.  Features include registering your new pollinator box via the included QR code, viewing existing pathway sites and their associated profiles, meeting and chatting with members, and a live map of the pathway!
2.	Customers:
A) New members of the pnw pollinator pathway who have just received a new pollinator kit from the pnw pollinator pathway organization.  They use the app to scan the included QR code after setting up their pollinator, so that it can be registered into the pathway using gps coordinates and a new profile may be built around it.
Persona and Scenario:
Matt has a farm and just joined the pollinator pathway.  He wants to set up his site information with a name, description, photos, and a link to his website. 
B) Existing members of the PNW Pollinator pathway who have already set up a pollinator and are registered.  They can use the app to view other members’ pollinator locations and information, edit their own profile/pollinator information, and delete their own profile and pathway presence entirely.
	Persona and Scenario:
	Matt’s Pollinator garden has expanded and he can go on the app to edit his information.
C) Administrators and owners of the PNW Pollinator pathway can use the app to approve new member requests to join the pathway, edit or delete new and existing profile information
Persona and Scenario:
Alex wants to have administrative access and control of accounts

1.	Future considerations
1.	Usability summary - key learnings and takeaways that were applied from the last round of usability studies on the high-fidelity prototype. Call out anything that hasn't been addressed in the design or app components to continue investigating in  the future.
Based on the usability studies on the high-fidelity prototype added a welcome screen to the registration flow with directions for how to register a new site.  We also fixed spacing and alignment consistency issues.  We adjusted the navigation by removing buttons on the landing page and utilizing the android bottom navigation.  We changed less important buttons to outlined instead of filled based on material design and changed the text in some buttons for clarity.  We also adjusted the background to make text boxes clearer.
2.	Monetization - Ads, one-time download fee, subscriptions.
3.	Measuring engagement - define active usage for your app, the actions over a day and month that indicates someone is a user of your app.
4.	Stretch features - future experience considerations not yet explored and tested.
